SPP payments are eligible for the pension income amount (see line 314). Tax Tips If you have to report your pension, annuity, PRPP, and RRIF payments on line 115, you may be able to claim the pension income amount (see line 314). You may also be able to make a joint election with your spouse or common-law partner to split your pension, annuity, PRPP, and RRIF (including life income fund) payments you reported on line 115 if both of the following apply: you were both residents of Canada on December 31, 2013 (or were residents of Canada on the date of death); and you and your spouse or common-law partner were not, because of a breakdown in your marriage or common-law relationship, living separate and apart from each other at the end of the year and for a period of 90 days beginning in the year. To make this election, you and your spouse or common-law partner must complete Form T1032, Joint Election to Split Pension Income. Note If you elected to split your pension, superannuation, annuity, PRPP, RRIF (including life income fund) payments, and SPP payments with your spouse or common-law partner, you (the pensioner) must still report the full amount on line 115, but you can claim a deduction for the elected split-pension amount. See line 210. Pensions from a foreign country Report in Canadian dollars the gross amount of your foreign pension income you received in 2013. See \"How do you report foreign income and other amounts?\" on page 9. Attach a note to your paper return identifying the type of pension you received and the country it came from. In some cases, amounts you receive may not be considered pension income, and you may have to report them elsewhere on your return. United States individual retirement arrangement (IRA) If, during 2013, you received amounts from an IRA or converted the IRA to a \"Roth\" IRA, contact us. Tax Tip You can claim a deduction on line 256 for the part of your foreign pension income that is tax-free in Canada because of a tax treaty. If you do not know whether any part of your foreign pension is tax-free, contact us. United States Social Security - Report on line 115 the full amount, in Canadian dollars, of your U.S. Social Security benefits and any U.S. Medicare premiums paid on your behalf. You can claim a deduction for part of this income. See line 256. Benefits paid for your children are their income, even if you received the payments.",

        "text": "The following is an overview of PAs under RPPs and DPSPs. If you want to know how your PA is calculated or why you have a PA, contact your employer or plan administrator. Your PA for a year is the total pension credits for the year under a DPSP or a defined benefit or money purchase provision of an RPP of which you are a member. You may also have a pension credit if you participate in a foreign plan. The pension credit is a measure of the value of the benefits that accrued to you during the year under these arrangements. Does your employer have to report a PA for you? Your employer usually has to report a PA for you even if your benefit is not yet vested. Where is your PA shown on your T4 or T4A slip? Your PA appears in box 52 of your T4 slip, or in box 034 of your T4A slip. If you worked for more than one employer in 2013 and each employer sponsors their own RPP or DPSP, you may have more than one PA for 2013. Enter the total of your 2013 PAs from your T4 or T4A slips on line 206 of your 2013 return. What does your PA affect? Your PA for a year reduces your RRSP deduction limit for the following year. Your PA does not affect your income. If you contribute to an RRSP or an SPP, your PA may indirectly affect the income taxes you pay or the refund you receive for the following year, because it reduces your RRSP deduction limit for the following year. For details on how to calculate your RRSP deduction limit, see \"Calculating your 2013 RRSP deduction limit\" on page 13. You can find your 2013 RRSP deduction limit on your latest notice of assessment or notice of reassessment. If you receive a certified Form T1004 after we send you your notice, we may reduce your 2013 RRSP deduction limit. In such a case, we will usually send you a T1028, Your RRSP Information for 2013, and give you your revised 2013 RRSP deduction limit when we have updated our records. You can also find out your RRSP deduction limit by registering for My Account. Once you've registered, you can access your RRSP Deduction Limit Statement online. For more information, see \"My Account\" on page 42. If you participate in a foreign plan, you may have to report an amount similar to a PA that will reduce your RRSP deduction limit for the following year. To determine the amount you have to report, call the International Enquiries for Individuals and Trusts at one of the following numbers: 1-855-284-5942 (toll free within Canada and the United States), or 613-940-8495 (from outside Canada and the United States-we accept collect calls by automated response. Please note that you may hear a beep and experience a normal connection delay.). For more information concerning PAs, see Guide T4084, Pension Adjustment Guide.",

        "text": "  Under the Family Relations Act, spouses generally share all assets that were used for a family purpose, regardless of the origin of the property. Significant discretion is used by the courts to divide family property. This regime is criticized because it is too difficult to predict and it promotes litigation. The Family Law Act reforms property division so that certain property, such as pre-relationship property and inheritances generally will not be shared upon separation, except for the growth in value of the excluded property during the relationship. The general rule is that family property and family debts are divided 50/50 upon separation. If an equal division of family property and debts causes significant unfairness, judges can provide one spouse with a larger share of the family property. In limited cases, such as long interdependent relationships, excluded property may be divided. These measures ensure there remains some flexibility to take into account a spouse's unique circumstances or vulnerabilities where appropriate. The most compelling reasons for changing the property regime are to make the law simpler, clearer, easier to apply and more fair. As a result, fewer people will need to go to court to settle their property disputes and the expense currently associated with property division will be reduced. The new property regime provides a default for property division, based on sharing the property that accrues during the relationship. If a couple does not wish to have property division rules apply to them, they can choose to opt out and make different arrangements through a written agreement. Judges will have less ability to overturn these agreements.",
